# Creating Your Own Mission

## Required

To create your mission, you will need to have the following modules placed:

**Carrier Strike - Add Carrier**
- 1 for each team (BLUFOR, OPFOR).
- Sync to the object you want to be the "carrier".

**Carrier Strike - Missile Target**
- 1 for each "carrier" (BLUFOR, OPFOR).
- Determines where the missiles will strike.

**Carrier Strike - Add Silo**
- 5 total, synchronized to a VLS Missile Launcher (BLUFOR >> NATO >> Turrets).
- Place these WITHOUT a crew.

**Carrier Strike - Init Game**
- 1 for the mission.

**Carrier Strike - Respawn Position**
- As many as you want for each team. Remember, silo positions automatically become spawn points for the team that owns it!

## Optional

These are optional systems that you can place. To enjoy the full Carrier Strike experience, you should use all systems.

**Carrier Strike - Add Vehicle**
- Place as many as you want (do not sync with anything).
- Provide the classes and direction. You can use a dummy vehicle to determine placement and direction, just remember to delete them after.

**Carrier Strike - Add Reactor**
- Place as many of these as you want for each team (BLUFOR, OPFOR).
- Sync to the objects you want to be a "reactor".
- Be sure to adjust how much damage these cause to the carrier when destroyed depending on how many you have.

**Carrier Strike - Add Turret**
- Place as many of these as you want for any team.
- Sync to the turret.
- Turret needs to be a kind of UAV.
- Place these WITHOUT a crew.

**Carrier Strike - Carrier Speaker**
- Place as many of these as you want (do not sync to anything).
- These provide ambient alert notifications and alarms that occur.

**Carrier Strike - Silo Speaker**
- Place as many of these as you want (do not sync to anything).
- These provide ambient alert notifications and alarms that occur.
- The silo is already a "speaker" itself.

**Carrier Strike - End Game Camera**
- Place 1 of these per carrier.
- The camera will target the carrier you have selected and when that team loses, all players will view that carrier as it explodes.
