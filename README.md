# Disclaimer - This is an ALPHA - There will be bugs!

I wanted to get this out since the main gameplay loop is finished to start collecting feedback. This has not had a balance pass yet, so be warned.  
Development is slow on weekdays, fast on weekends. Expect frequent updates.

# How To Play

**Phase 1: Ground War - Control the Missile Silos**  
- Fight across the battlefield to control missile silos.  
- Capture and hold missile silos to weaken the enemy carrier hull.  
- The more silos you control, the faster the enemy's defenses fall.  

**Phase 2: Carrier Assault - Board and Destroy**  
- Once the enemy carrier defenses fall, the real battle begins!  
- Storm the enemy carrier via any means necessary.  
- Fight across the carrier and destroy the carrier reactors.  
- Destroying reactors cause the carrier to receive large chunks of hull damage.  
- Continue holding silos for consistent damage.  

**Beware - A Rebellion Has Formed**  
- A third faction has been added. They will not contribute towards the objective, but they will be there to mess up your day! Play as the Independent faction and mess up the other two teams!
